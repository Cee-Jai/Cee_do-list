Cee_do-list
A beginner-friendly to-do list app to track your agility—how efficiently you complete tasks. Built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, it starts as a simple task manager and will become "QuestBoard," a gamified productivity tool.
🚀 Overview
Cee_do-list helps you manage tasks and monitor your agility. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) provides core task management with a responsive interface and cloud storage. Designed for beginners, it’s modular and will grow to include points, badges, and social features.
📝 Learning Notes
I’m documenting my journey in NOTES.md, capturing lessons learned as a beginner. It covers Git, project setup, and more—check it out to learn alongside me!
MVP Features

Tasks: Add, edit, delete, toggle complete/incomplete.
UI: Responsive, color-coded tasks (green for done, gray for pending).
Data: Tasks saved in MongoDB Atlas.
Agility: Foundation for tracking task speed.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS.
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas.
Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend).
Tools: Git/GitHub, Neovim (or your preferred editor).

🛠️ Setup
Set up the project with these steps. Use Node.js 16.x (LTS) or add NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider for v17+. Week 1 starts May 5, 2025.
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16.x recommended).
Git.
Neovim (install: sudo apt install neovim).
MongoDB Atlas (for Week 3+).

Steps

Clone Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Cee-Jai/Cee_do-list.git
cd Cee_do-list

Use a Personal Access Token.

Create Folders:
mkdir client server


Frontend Setup:
cd client
npx create-react-app .
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

Update tailwind.config.js:
nvim tailwind.config.js

Add:
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
};

Update src/App.js (add import):
nvim src/App.js

Add at the top:
import React from 'react';

Update src/index.css:
nvim src/index.css

Add:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

Test:
npm start


Backend Setup:
cd ../server
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors dotenv

Add server/.env (use .env.example as a template):
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri_here
PORT=5000


Push to GitHub:

After changes, commit and push:git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main


This backs up your work on GitHub, protecting against OS crashes.



Verify Setup

Root: ls should show: README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore, .env.example, CONTRIBUTING.md, client/, server/.
Client: cd client && npm start should load http://localhost:3000.
Server: cd server && ls should show package.json, .env.

Data Security

GitHub Backup: Push regularly to GitHub to back up your code.
Secure .env: .gitignore ignores server/.env (MongoDB URL). Back it up separately:cp server/.env ~/secure_backup_env


Recovery: If your OS crashes, clone from GitHub and restore .env.

Troubleshooting

Node.js: Check: node -v. Install v16.x: sudo npm install -g n; sudo n 16.20.2.
JSX Errors: Add import React from 'react'; to src/App.js using nvim.
Git Conflicts: If git pull fails with "divergent branches":git config pull.rebase false
git pull origin main

Resolve conflicts in nvim, then git add, git commit, git push.
MongoDB: Sign up at MongoDB Atlas.
Help: See React Tutorial.

📂 Structure

client/src/: React components (e.g., TaskForm.js, TaskList.js in Week 2).
server/: API endpoints, MongoDB schemas.
.gitignore: Ignores .env, node_modules, etc., for security and cleanliness.
.env.example: Template for environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URL).
CONTRIBUTING.md: Guidelines for contributors.
NOTES.md: My learning notes as a beginner.
README.md: This guide.

📋 Data Structure

Tasks (MVP):
title: String (e.g., "Buy groceries").
description: String (e.g., "Milk, bread, eggs").
completed: Boolean (true/false).
createdAt: Date (when added).
completedAt: Date (for agility tracking).


Future (Gamification):
Points: Number (e.g., +10 for on-time).
Badges: Name, earned date (e.g., “Agile Sprinter”).



📅 Roadmap
Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-8, Private)

Week 1 (May 5-11): Set up client/server, add essential files.
Week 2: Build task UI (add/delete tasks with TaskForm.js, TaskList.js).
Weeks 3-4: Create API, MongoDB.
Weeks 5-6: Connect frontend-backend.
Week 7: Style UI, responsive.
Week 8: Deploy to Vercel/Render.

Phase 2: Gamification (Weeks 9-12, Private)

Weeks 9-10: Points system.
Week 11: Badges (e.g., “Agile Sprinter”).
Week 12: Progress charts.

Phase 3: Public (Weeks 13-15, Public)

Go public, add CONTRIBUTING.md.
Invite contributors via X.
Add: Agility metrics, notifications.

🤝 Contributing (Week 13+)
Beginners can code, design, test. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
