# Cee_do-list
**A to do list that will help you track your agility**
This will act as the source code, documentation, and development tasks for a beginner-friendly web-based to-do list application designed to help users manage tasks and track their agility—how quickly and efficiently they complete tasks. The app starts as a simple to-do list (MVP) and will evolve into a gamified productivity tool called “QuestBoard” with features like points, badges, and progress tracking.
